    <p class="info">An Artist based company dealing in the selling, collecting and preservation of Kenyan Art. We believe in the attainment of Freedom through Art.
        OUR VISION – Freedom through Art.
        OUR MISSION – To promote African Art and African artists.
        The Art created is by different Kenyan artists expressing their understanding of concepts within and beyond their thoughts, feelings, environment, relationships, personal research and Experience.
        With the use of visuals, the artists depict the aspects of the reality that we live in today with some nostalgia to ‘how it used to be’. In the understanding that freedom can be acquired through art; the artists at Morianah Inc aim to express, educate and sensitize their visions of the broad and diverse optical lens that is the rich Afro -Kenyan culture.
        Using techniques of colour co-ordination, texture building, aesthetics and emotional sense that comes with visual expression; the artists create pieces suitable to be curated at any space or place. From a view of home, office or restaurant they serve a purpose to connect with the viewer from a physical, visual, mental or emotional perspective that honours the handcraft of an artist.
        Subjects of the art differ as the artists decide to create realistically, contemporarily or simply abstract art. The collection ranges of still life subjects, landscapes, portraits or conceptual creation by the artists using charcoal, collages, acrylic and oil paint as mediums of creation. This skilful nature of adding colour, texture and pattern co-relates with both the functional and aesthetics which could soften or emphasize the architectural qualities of a space. We are African Artists, and proud of it!
        BUSINESS and TECHNOLOGY.
        In the light of the 2020 global pandemic that destroyed many lives, a great awakening was realized. Quarantined, we were moved to make internal/external assessments of what it meant to be artists in a dynamic and changing world. This was the birth of Morianah.
        At Morianah, we aim to promote African art and artists to rise to the global stage. This means an early adoption into the metaverse and NFT space. Our goal is to become the leading Art company in Africa, from Nairobi, to the World.
